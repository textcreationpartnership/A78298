            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </head>
            <p>AFter many Viſits made to him in the Priſon, on the Lords-Day before his Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, he made this Confeſſion to the Ordinary. That he had good Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and was put forth an Apprentice to a Grocer, but not delighting in that imployment, he left it, and after that, entred himſelf Voluntary into Mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Service, for Six Years paſt, during which time, he contracted Acquaintance with the unfortunate Perſon, who fell by his hand, the manner of which, he ſaid, was, as followeth.</p>
            <p>That himſelf and the perſon killed by him, were drinking together, during which time, this Acquaintance gave him very reproachful Language, whereupon Mr. <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well</hi> made a Reſolute Proteſtation that he would have ſatisfaction for his affronting him; The other in a careleſs manner, replyed, Pre-thee what ſatisfaction wouldſt thou have, we will go and Friendly drink together, ſo they did; and afterwards parted for that night. But when Mr. <hi>Caſwel</hi> came home, and was alone, he paſſionate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly renewed the reproaches in his Mind: In the Morning, he went to the Lodging of the Deceaſed, and finding him in bed, did in anger, bid him Riſe, for he would have Juſtice of him, which he wondred at, ſaying we are Friends, we will go and drink again, which they did, in ſeveral places to an Exceſs. And the Deceaſed paid the Reckoning: But Mr. <hi>Caſwel</hi> being too much heatted with drink, ſaid, this is not ſufficient, I am reſolved to fight you, which the other declined, but Mr. <hi>Caſwell</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiued urging him to fight, whereupon the Deceaſed, (as he ſays) fetcht a Sword, and they went apart where Mr. <hi>Caſwel</hi> drew upon him, and he fell, at which he was ſtartled and hoped that his wound was not Mortal, tho it prov'd contrary, upon which, he was immediately apprehended, being in Priſon, and coming to his Right Mind, he fell into great Terror of Conſcience, as thinking his Sin to be unpardonable, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the Ordinary was ſent for, to pray with him, and Endeavoured to Support him from Deſpare. The great aggravation of the Crime, and which multiplyed his Terror, was that he had thruſt a Man out of the World ſo unprepared for Death; which troubles him as much as the loſs of his own Life. In my Obſervation of him, he ſeemed full of Remorſe for ſo vile a Fact. I hope others will take warning from him to avoid immoderate Paſſion, leſt they fall into the ſame miſery, into which he hath brought himſelf.</p>
            <p>Being Conveyed to <hi>Tyburn</hi> in a Coach, when he came into the Cart he kneeled down alone and prayed very fervently for himſelf, afterwards being Tyed to the Tree, the Ordinary and another Miniſter, who came with him as his Friend, both prayed for him, according to the publick prayers of the Liturgy, which ſuited his diſtreſt dying Eſtate, himſelf repeating the ſame words. After this a Penitential <hi>Pſalm</hi> was ſung, he joyning in it; then he deſired the Ordinary and the other Miniſter to make their ſeveral Prayers for him, which they did. Then he did hold the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Paper in Writing to the Spectators in his hand, but ſpoke it word for word by Memory: and delivered it to the Ordinary to be Printed with the Subſcription of his hand to it, to prevent any falſe reports of him.</p>

            <p>His Beheavour was very Reverent and Compoſed, deſiring the prayers of all the Spectators, which moved them Generally to Lament his ſad untimely End with Tears. After this, he Ordered the Executioner not to turn him off till he gave ſome ſign; ſo after a Prayer made to himſelf, the Cart drew away, he firſt committing his Soul to Gods Infinite Mercy, as a Faithful Creator and Redeemer. To this whole Account as the Truth of his Confeſſion, Laſt Speech and Deportment, at the place of Suffering, I do Subſcrib my hand as he deſired me.</p>
